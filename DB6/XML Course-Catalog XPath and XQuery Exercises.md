# XML Course-Catalog XPath and XQuery Exercises

In these exercises, you will be working with a small XML data set drawn from the Stanford course catalog. There are multiple departments, each with a department chair, some courses, and professors and/or lecturers who teach courses. The XML data is [here](https://prod-c2g.s3.amazonaws.com/db/Winter2013/files/courses-noID.xml).
