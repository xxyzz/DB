# SQL Social-Network Query Exercises

Students at your hometown high school have decided to organize their social network using databases. So far, they have collected information about sixteen students in four grades, 9-12. Here's the schema:

Highschooler ( ID, name, grade )
English: There is a high school student with unique *ID* and a given *first name* in a certain *grade*.

Friend ( ID1, ID2 )
English: The student with *ID1* is friends with the student with *ID2*. Friendship is mutual, so if (123, 456) is in the Friend table, so is (456, 123).

Likes ( ID1, ID2 )
English: The student with *ID1* likes the student with *ID2*. Liking someone is not necessarily mutual, so if (123, 456) is in the Likes table, there is no guarantee that (456, 123) is also present.

Your queries will run over a small data set conforming to the schema. [View the database](https://lagunita.stanford.edu/c4x/DB/SQL/asset/socialdata.html). (You can also [download the schema and data](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/prod-c2g/db/Winter2013/files/social.sql).)

For your convenience, here is a graph showing the various connections between the students in our database. 9th graders are blue, 10th graders are green, 11th graders are yellow, and 12th graders are purple. Undirected black edges indicate friendships, and directed red edges indicate that one student likes another student.

## Q1

Find the names of all students who are friends with someone named Gabriel.

```sql
SELECT name
FROM Highschooler
WHERE ID IN (SELECT Friend.ID1
             FROM Highschooler JOIN Friend
             WHERE Highschooler.ID = Friend.ID2 AND Highschooler.name = 'Gabriel');
```

## Q2

For every student who likes someone 2 or more grades younger than themselves, return that student's name and grade, and the name and grade of the student they like.

```sql
SELECT S1.name, S1.grade, S2.name, S2.grade
FROM (
    (
        SELECT id, name, grade
        FROM Highschooler JOIN Likes
        WHERE Highschooler.ID = Likes.ID1
    ) S1 JOIN (
        SELECT Likes.ID1 AS id, name, grade
        FROM Highschooler JOIN Likes
        WHERE Highschooler.ID = Likes.ID2
    ) S2 USING(id)
)
WHERE S1.grade - S2.grade > 1;
```

## Q3

For every pair of students who both like each other, return the name and grade of both students. Include each pair only once, with the two names in alphabetical order.

```sql
SELECT H1.name, H1.grade, H2.name, H2.grade
FROM Highschooler H1, Highschooler H2, (
    SELECT L1.ID1 AS ID1, L1.ID2 AS ID2
    FROM Likes L1 JOIN Likes L2
    ON L1.ID1 = L2.ID2 AND L1.ID2 = L2.ID1
) 
WHERE H1.ID = ID1 AND H2.ID = ID2 AND H1.name < H2.name;
```

## Q4

Find all students who do not appear in the Likes table (as a student who likes or is liked) and return their names and grades. Sort by grade, then by name within each grade.

```sql
SELECT name, grade
FROM Highschooler
WHERE ID NOT IN (
    SELECT ID1
    FROM Likes
    UNION
    SELECT ID2
    FROM Likes
)
ORDER BY grade, name;
```

## Q5

For every situation where student A likes student B, but we have no information about whom B likes (that is, B does not appear as an ID1 in the Likes table), return A and B's names and grades.

 ```sql
SELECT H1.name, H1.grade, H2.name, H2.grade
FROM Highschooler H1, Highschooler H2, (
    SELECT ID1, ID2
    FROM Likes
    WHERE ID2 NOT IN (SELECT ID1 FROM Likes)
)
WHERE H1.ID = ID1 AND H2.ID = ID2;
 ```

## Q6

Find names and grades of students who only have friends in the same grade. Return the result sorted by grade, then by name within each grade.

```sql
SELECT name, grade
FROM Highschooler
WHERE ID NOT IN (
    SELECT H1.ID
    FROM Highschooler H1, Highschooler H2, Friend
    WHERE H1.ID = ID1 AND H2.ID = ID2 AND H1.grade <> H2.grade
)
ORDER BY grade, name;
```

## Q7

For each student A who likes a student B where the two are not friends, find if they have a friend C in common (who can introduce them!). For all such trios, return the name and grade of A, B, and C.

```sql
SELECT H1.name, H1.grade, H2.name, H2.grade, H3.name, H3.grade
FROM Highschooler H1, Highschooler H2, Highschooler H3
WHERE (
    H2.ID IN (SELECT ID2
              FROM Likes
              WHERE ID1 = H1.ID)
    AND H2.ID NOT IN (SELECT ID2
                      FROM Friend
                      WHERE ID1 = H1.ID)
    AND H3.ID IN (SELECT ID2
                  FROM Friend
                  WHERE ID1 = H1.ID)
    AND H3.ID IN (SELECT ID2
                  FROM Friend
                  WHERE ID1 = H2.ID) 
);
```

## Q8

Find the difference between the number of students in the school and the number of different first names.

```sql
SELECT COUNT(ID) - COUNT(DISTINCT name)
FROM Highschooler;
```

## Q9

Find the name and grade of all students who are liked by more than one other student.

```sql
SELECT name, grade
FROM Highschooler
WHERE ID IN (
    SELECT L1.ID2
    FROM Likes L1, Likes L2
    WHERE L1.ID1 <> L2.ID1 AND L1.ID2 = L2.ID2
);
```

## Q1

For every situation where student A likes student B, but student B likes a different student C, return the names and grades of A, B, and C.

```sql
SELECT H1.name, H1.grade, H2.name, H2.grade, H3.name, H3.grade
FROM Highschooler H1, Highschooler H2, Highschooler H3
WHERE H2.ID IN (
    SELECT ID2
    FROM Likes
    WHERE ID1 = H1.ID
) AND H1.ID NOT IN (
    SELECT ID2

## Q3

What is the average number of friends per student? (Your result should be just one number.)
